### Return Forecasting: Initial Time-Series Plotting

*Question: Do you see any patterns, long-term and/or short?*

- Based on the initial time series plot above, we can see a long-term strengthening of the Japanese Yen against the Dollar. The medium-term time frame of 1-3 year shows consistent trends, but on a daily basis, there are a lot of short-term ups and downs.

### Conclusion

(I) Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?
* If you're an investor with a high-risk tolerance, you would buy the YEN now but if you are risk averse, you would not buy the yen.

(II) Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?
* Based on the volatility of YEN, its risk is expected to increase.

(III) Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?
* Yes, I would. I feel that the models are a good representation of YEN's expected future performance

### Conclusion

* The out-of-sample RMSE (0.415%) is lower than the in-sample RMSE (0.565%). Therefore, it is better to use out-of-sample data that the model hasn't seen before because it gives us a higher accuracy in our predictions and thus a better performance than in-sample data that the model was trained on.
